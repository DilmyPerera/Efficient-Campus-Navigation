# **Efficient Campus Navigation**

## **A Shortest Path Finding System for the University of Vavuniya**

---

## **Introduction**

Navigating the University of Vavuniya campus can be challenging due to its complex layout. To address this issue, we have developed an efficient campus navigation system. This system aims to provide students, staff, and visitors with the shortest and most efficient paths between any two locations on campus.

## **Purpose**

The primary objective of this project is to enhance campus navigation, ensuring safety and efficiency. By implementing a pathfinding system based on Dijkstra's Algorithm, the project aims to:

- Improve day-to-day navigation for students and staff.
- Enhance emergency response times.
- Facilitate better event management.
- Ensure accessibility for all individuals.
- Reduce environmental impact and psychological stress associated with navigation.

## **Features**

- **Interactive Map Interface**: A user-friendly, interactive map to help users visualize and navigate the campus.
- **Path Calculation** : Computes the shortest path between two locations
- **Emergency Routing**: Specialized routing to assist in quick emergency response.
- **Scalability** : Designed to accommodate future campus expansions and data integrations.

## **Technology Stack**

- Programming Language: **Python**
- Algorithms: **Dijkstra's Algorithm** for shortest path calculation
- Libraries :
  - **Tkinter** for GUI
  - **PIL** **(Pillow)** for image processing
  - **heapq** for priority queue operations
  - **math** for calculations
  - **ImageTk** for handling images in Tkinter
